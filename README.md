## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment** i.e. **JDK 1.8** or higher. We recommend using the latest version.

- Install **Maven** which supports **TestNG** framework out of the box. **Maven** can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

### Cloning Repo And Installing Dependencies

Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s Java-TestNG-Selenium repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishnukdas/hyperexecute_dex_java
cd hyperexecute_dex_java
```

You can also run the command below to resolve all dependencies.

```bash
mvn compile
```


### Triggering The Job

The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command.

```bash
mvn test -Dsuite=xml/api.xml
```

Your test results would be displayed on LambdaTest HyperExecute dashboard.
